# Project Roadmap: Scientific Data Integration System

## Project Title
Scientific Data Integration System: JSON to CSV Converter for Scientific Production Reports

## Project Objectives

### General Objective
Develop a Java-based application to automate the conversion of scientific production data from JSON format to CSV format, reducing manual processing time while maintaining data quality.

### Specific Objectives
1. Create comprehensive documentation of SCRUM methodology and file formats
2. Develop core functionality for JSON parsing and transformation
3. Implement CSV generation with configurable output formats
4. Provide a complete, well-documented solution with testing and examples

## Timeline and Deliverables

### Project Schedule: September 16–28, 2025

| Date         | Milestone/Deliverable                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sep 16       | Repository setup, initial documentation, SCRUM methodology         |
| Sep 17       | Product backlog creation, research on file formats and libraries   |
| Sep 18–19    | Project structure setup, finalize documentation                   |
| Sep 20–21    | JSON file reading and parsing implementation, unit tests          |
| Sep 22–23    | Data transformation framework, mapping logic                      |
| Sep 24–25    | CSV file generation, unit tests                                   |
| Sep 26       | Configuration system, batch processing                            |
| Sep 27       | Performance optimization, error handling improvements             |
| Sep 28       | Complete JavaDoc documentation, final testing, bug fixes, delivery|

**Deliverables:**
- Complete project documentation
- Research report on appropriate libraries
- Project backlog and roadmap
- Working prototype with basic JSON to CSV conversion
- Unit test suite for core functionality
- Technical documentation of implemented features
- Complete application with all features
- Comprehensive documentation including JavaDoc
- User guide and examples
- Final test reports

## Key Stakeholders and Roles
- **Beatriz Solórzano:** Developer
- **Érika:** Department Director (Product Owner)
- **Hortensia:** Subject Matter Expert (Previous Manual Process)

## Critical Path
1. Research and selection of appropriate libraries (Sprint 1)
2. JSON parsing implementation (Sprint 2)
3. Data transformation framework (Sprint 2)
4. CSV generation (Sprint 2)
5. Configuration system (Sprint 3)

## Dependencies
- JSON parsing must be completed before data transformation
- Data transformation must be completed before CSV generation
- Basic functionality must be working before configuration system implementation

## Risk Management
- **Risk:** Complex JSON structures may be difficult to map to CSV
  - **Mitigation:** Early prototyping of challenging data structures

- **Risk:** Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation:** Incremental testing with increasingly large data sets

- **Risk:** Changing requirements
  - **Mitigation:** Regular stakeholder reviews and flexible architecture
