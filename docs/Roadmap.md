# Project Roadmap: Scientific Data Integration System

## Project Title
Scientific Data Integration System: JSON to CSV Converter for Scientific Production Reports

## Project Objectives

### General Objective
Develop a Java-based application to automate the conversion of scientific production data from JSON format to CSV format, reducing manual processing time while maintaining data quality.

### Specific Objectives
1. Create comprehensive documentation of SCRUM methodology and file formats
2. Develop core functionality for JSON parsing and transformation
3. Implement CSV generation with configurable output formats
4. Provide a complete, well-documented solution with testing and examples

## Timeline and Deliverables

### Sprint 1: Documentation and Research (Weeks 1-2)
- **Week 1:**
  - Repository setup and initial documentation
  - Research on JSON and CSV formats
  - Documentation of SCRUM methodology
  
- **Week 2:**
  - Product backlog creation
  - Research on Java libraries for JSON and CSV processing
  - Initial project structure setup
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Complete project documentation
  - Research report on appropriate libraries
  - Project backlog and roadmap

### Sprint 2: Core Development (Weeks 3-5)
- **Week 3:**
  - JSON file reading and parsing implementation
  - Unit tests for JSON parsing
  
- **Week 4:**
  - Data transformation framework development
  - Mapping logic between JSON and CSV structures
  
- **Week 5:**
  - CSV file generation implementation
  - Unit tests for CSV output
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Working prototype with basic JSON to CSV conversion
  - Unit test suite for core functionality
  - Technical documentation of implemented features

### Sprint 3: Enhancement and Completion (Weeks 6-8)
- **Week 6:**
  - Configuration system implementation
  - Batch processing capabilities
  
- **Week 7:**
  - Performance optimization
  - Error handling improvements
  
- **Week 8:**
  - Complete JavaDoc documentation
  - Final testing and bug fixes
  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Complete application with all features
  - Comprehensive documentation including JavaDoc
  - User guide and examples
  - Final test reports

## Key Stakeholders and Roles
- **Beatriz Solórzano:** Developer
- **Érika:** Department Director (Product Owner)
- **Hortensia:** Subject Matter Expert (Previous Manual Process)

## Critical Path
1. Research and selection of appropriate libraries (Sprint 1)
2. JSON parsing implementation (Sprint 2)
3. Data transformation framework (Sprint 2)
4. CSV generation (Sprint 2)
5. Configuration system (Sprint 3)

## Dependencies
- JSON parsing must be completed before data transformation
- Data transformation must be completed before CSV generation
- Basic functionality must be working before configuration system implementation

## Risk Management
- **Risk:** Complex JSON structures may be difficult to map to CSV
  - **Mitigation:** Early prototyping of challenging data structures

- **Risk:** Performance issues with large datasets
  - **Mitigation:** Incremental testing with increasingly large data sets

- **Risk:** Changing requirements
  - **Mitigation:** Regular stakeholder reviews and flexible architecture
