# Project Backlog

## User Stories

### US1: Project Setup and Documentation
**As a** developer,  
**I want to** set up the project repository and documentation,  
**So that** I have a solid foundation for development and a clear understanding of requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Git repository is initialized with proper structure
- README is created with project overview
- SCRUM methodology is documented
- JSON and CSV characteristics are documented
- Product backlog with user stories is created
- Project roadmap is established

### US2: JSON File Loading and Parsing
**As a** data integration specialist,  
**I want to** load and parse JSON files containing scientific publication data,  
**So that** I can access and manipulate the data programmatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Java application can read JSON files from a specified location
- Application can parse JSON structure correctly
- Error handling for malformed JSON files
- Support for different JSON structures with publication data
- Unit tests verify parsing functionality

### US3: Data Transformation Framework
**As a** data integration specialist,  
**I want to** transform JSON data into a format suitable for CSV output,  
**So that** complex nested structures can be represented in tabular form.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Framework for flattening nested JSON objects
- Logic to handle arrays and collections
- Support for mapping JSON fields to CSV columns
- Configurable transformation rules
- Unit tests for transformation logic

### US4: CSV File Generation
**As a** report generator,  
**I want to** create CSV files from the transformed data,  
**So that** the information can be used in spreadsheet applications and reporting tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CSV files are generated with correct formatting
- Header row contains appropriate column names
- Data types are properly represented in CSV format
- Escape special characters according to CSV standards
- Unit tests verify CSV output against expected format

### US5: Configuration Options
**As a** system user,  
**I want to** configure the JSON to CSV conversion parameters,  
**So that** I can customize the output according to specific reporting needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Command-line parameters for input/output paths
- Configuration file support for mapping rules
- Options to include/exclude specific fields
- Settings for CSV formatting (delimiters, quote characters)
- Documentation of all configuration options

### US6: Batch Processing
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want to** process multiple JSON files in a single operation,  
**So that** large datasets can be converted efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support for processing directories of JSON files
- Option to merge multiple JSON files into a single CSV
- Progress reporting during batch operations
- Error handling that doesn't stop the entire batch
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### US7: Comprehensive Documentation
**As a** future maintainer,  
**I want to** have comprehensive code documentation,  
**So that** I can understand the system structure and extend it if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JavaDoc comments for all classes and methods
- Package documentation explaining architecture
- Examples of common usage patterns
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- UML diagrams of the system structure
