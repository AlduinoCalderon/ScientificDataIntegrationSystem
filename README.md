# Scientific Data Integration System

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Java-based solution for automating the conversion of JSON files to CSV files for the Scientometrics Department at the university. The project aims to reduce information integration time while maintaining data quality, replacing a previously manual process.

## Project Context
Beatriz Sol√≥rzano, a Computer Systems Administration graduate working at a university, has been hired by the Scientometrics Department to automate their data integration process. The project involves developing a Java application to convert scientific production data from JSON format to CSV, streamlining the generation of bi-monthly scientific production reports.

## Project Structure
- `docs/` - Project documentation
  - `SCRUM_Concepts.md` - Documentation of SCRUM methodology
  - `File_Formats.md` - Documentation of JSON and CSV characteristics
  - `Backlog.md` - Product backlog with user stories
- `src/` - Source code for the Java application
- `data/` - Example data files for testing

## Technologies
- Java
- JSON Libraries (to be determined)
- CSV Libraries (to be determined)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Development Phases
1. **Documentation and Research**: Understanding the current process and researching appropriate libraries
2. **Code Development and Testing**: Implementing JSON parsing and CSV generation with modular testing
3. **Full Integration and Documentation**: Completing the application with comprehensive documentation

## Sprint Planning
This project follows the SCRUM methodology and is divided into three sprints:
1. **Sprint 1**: Documentation of SCRUM methodology and file formats
2. **Sprint 2**: Development of core functionality for JSON to CSV conversion
3. **Sprint 3**: Parameter configuration, complete integration, and JavaDoc documentation

## Setup Instructions
